# What are ticks

Ticks are some hard ass cunts they have no necks(the cunts), they are tough as nails,
they can survive without food for as long as 18 WEEKS, and can survive temps bellow
zero(up to ~ -7 Celsius) for two weeks.

Good thing they are not very mobile, can't jump can't fly, can't really run either so how do they get attached to their "host", they literary
just stay attached to some tall grass and wait the goddamned parasites can't even bother
to search for food.

_oookay never mind read here in wikipedia some do actively search for food, they go find nests, most of em don't though_

## Where are ticks

Some good predictors of dense tick population are: sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, and the presence of deer.
Pretty much **humid weather + tall grass = ticks**

## When are ticks

Tick season is usually during spring and summer. But if weather is warm and not too dry you could have a year-round tick party.

## Are ticks good

**No** They are _cunts_ and spread **diseases**, lots of em.

## How to demolish ticks

Enemy number one of ticks is the mighty Opossum, so a pocket possum might be a good solution.

### Chewables

Seem cool, have some tasty flavours, the bravecto ones lasts around 3 months

**Bravecto Chews for Dogs**
**NexGard Chewables for Dogs**
**Simparica Trio Chewable Tablets for Dogs**
For ticks and heartworm, hookworms, and roundworms. So its like a 2 in 1 combo.

### Topical/droplets

Some dogs are really picky eaters so this might come in handy, have personally used droplets and they seemed to work, I've used them for only a couple of months though so not sure if I'm to be trusted.

Some topicals kill only after the tick has bitten in and some kill on contact, should be considered.

**K9 Advantix II Flea, Tick and Mosquito Prevention for Dogs, 6 Doses**
_Kills on contact_

**PetArmor Plus Flea & Tick Spot Treatment for Dogs**
_Kills after application/bite_

### Collars

_My favourite_

**Seresto 8 Month Flea & Tick Prevention Collar**
I am currently using this one.
Pros:

- Advertising says it should lasts 8 months
- _Kills on touch_
- Doesn't smell and isn't greasy to the touch
- Can be used in combination with a chewable or oral.
  Cons:
- I still find goddamn ticks. Some aren't attached, some are, some have even reached a staggering size before I've detected them.

# Summary
